* Write a parser for the nestest log to compare state
* Add an argument parser to switch between logging options
* Get PPU working
** Need to add additional logging for sprites
** Should start to render sprites instead of just the background
* Implement controllers
** Add an interface like the rest of the devices (perhaps this should be a trait??)
** Implement different types of interfaces, maybe try to connect a real controller
* Implement the APU
** Need to think of some way to test this
