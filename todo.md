=TODO=

* Add an argument parser to switch between logging options
* Add instruction trace capabilities
* Make existing tracing more logical. Right now it's kind of just everywhere
* Implement controllers
** Add an interface like the rest of the devices (perhaps this should be a trait??)
** Implement different types of interfaces, maybe try to connect a real controller
* Implement the APU
** Need to think of some way to test this
